# Tracking

Notes on tracking in nebokrai.

The main benefits of doing tracking in this way are that it will allow me to 
track from my phone (via Signal and a server) as well as my computer.

## Routines

Similar to the Telegram chatbot I made, this automatically sends a message at 
the appropriate time for each routine and allows me to reply indicating when I 
have completed it.

## Habits

It supposedly takes 21 days to form a habit. The habit tracker 

## Streaks

Keeps track of consecutive {{interval}} in which I have completed a task.

## Progress and metrics (and progress visualization)

Tracks and visualizes the % completion for each roadmap and project.

## Additional Logging (area-specific)

* nutrition
* physical activity (esp. workouts)
* phone and media usage
* work (work times, productivity)
